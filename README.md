# Cole-Cole-Plot_Generator

This python script plots a cole-cole-plot using the experimental values from a dat.file (gained by a SQUID magnetometer) and the fitted values from an out.file (gained by CCFit.exe)

CCFit2.exe/.py can be found under http://www.nfchilton.com/cc-fit and is open available.

NOTE: There is no compiled version yet, so you need to have python installed in order to run the script.
